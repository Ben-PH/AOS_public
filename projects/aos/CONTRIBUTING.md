# Contributing

This might be wishful thinking, but if you want to contribute, that would be awesome.

## Documentation

This is a teaching repository. Primarily for myself with the hope of being useful to others. Anything to further that effort is most valued.

## Review the code

#### Inexperienced?

Great! Let me know and I'll put in extra effort to make your code review as much of a learning experience as possible. I would see this largely as a chance to exercise your growth mindset, with the possible added bonus of seeing your contributions. 

#### Experienced?

Also Great! I would not call myself an experienced developer, every little bit of help and advice would be amazing.

## Hidden components

Unfortunately, there many things that are hidden. This is due to the fact that this project is modelled on the UNSW AOS course, and so making it available would be a resource for student misconduct. Instead of source code, compiled binaries will be provided.

I plan to complete the project as part of my studies, so I cannot accept any help with anything that is not already implemented without first having a chat with course runners.

In the meantime, hidden components are on a seperate, private repo. Compiled binaries from there are pushed to here.

## Migrating to Rust

The plan is to migrate the provided libraries (see initial commit in history) into Rust, to reduce the ammount of C that needs to be called from Rust.
